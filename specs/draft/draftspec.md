_2. Overview.
  - problem to solve
  - how will we solve it, vaguely?
  - goals for project?_

We will implement some sorting algorithms and prove their correctness
using

_3. Prioritized (specific, concrete) feature list.
  1. "Core features": a minimal feature set sth the project can be considered
  complete only if all of these features are done._

  Implement sorting functions on int lists, with lists defined as we
  find them in "Software Foundations".
  
  _2. "Cool extensions": helpful features that make the project better
  if done._
  
_4. Technical Specification (1-2pp.) (*The hard part.*)
  - What is the design / architecture of our project?
  - What interfaces will we use to *modularize* the project?
    (How will we break up parts of our project that can be "cleanly
    separated")?
    - For each interface:
      1. What is the signature of this interface (which functions/types/values
        will it need/export?)
      2. Describe implementation of each interface on a high level.
	  - (Perhaps include a diagram of relationships among interfaces.)_
	  
_5. Next steps ("a contract with yourselves").
  - Which languages / tools / frameworks will we need?
    - One next step: try out these tools; get them up and running. Get
      familiar with them / do some basic exercises.
  - Which problems might we run into later in our project?
  - We need to get our environments set up._
