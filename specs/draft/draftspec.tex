\section{Overview}
\begin{description}
  \item[\textbf{Problem:}]
    Verify Timsort, python's preferred sorting algorithm!
  \item[\textbf{Solution sketch:}]
    We will take an incremental approach:
    We're going to start with an abstract
    "implementation" of Timsort,
    possibly black-boxing certian difficult-to-implement features
    such as heuristics used in the algorithm,
    and implement a verified version of that implementation to sort
    lists of natural numbers (defined inductively).
    Timsort is a hybrid sorting
    algorithm, requiring other sorting sub-algorithms and some simple data
    structures, so we will divide our project into interfaces for each of
    these, along with interfaces for proof tactics.
    We're going to hone our sorting algorithm verification chops
    by working through insertion sort and mergesort, both of which
    are part of Timsort, followed by tree sort sort and heap sort
    to test our data structures, followed by Timsort itself!
  \item[\textbf{Goals:}]
    Primarily, we'd like to verify Timsort as a way to learn more about
    Coq and certified programming. (If Timsort proves to be too
    complicated (by our estimation by the time the final spec is due),
    we will be able to accomplish this same learning outcome by working
    through insertion, merge, tree, and heap sorts.
