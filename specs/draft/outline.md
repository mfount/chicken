# Draft spec outline
Created by mfount from cs51 course doc.
(See //handouts.)
* Whole doc should be 3-4 pp. total.

1. Names and emails
2. Overview.
  - problem to solve
  - how will we solve it, vaguely?
  - goals for project?
3. Prioritized (specific, concrete) feature list.
  1. "Core features": a minimal feature set sth the project can be considered
    complete only if all of these features are done.
  2. "Cool extensions": helpful features that make the project better if done.
4. Technical Specification (1-2pp.) (*The hard part.*)
  - What is the design / architecture of our project?
  - What interfaces will we use to *modularize* the project?
    (How will we break up parts of our project that can be "cleanly
    separated")?
    - For each interface:
      1. What is the signature of this interface (which functions/types/values
        will it need/export?)
      2. Describe implementation of each interface on a high level.
  - (Perhaps include a diagram of relationships among interfaces.)
5. Next steps ("a contract with yourselves").
  - Which languages / tools / frameworks will we need?
    - One next step: try out these tools; get them up and running. Get
      familiar with them / do some basic exercises.
  - Which problems might we run into later in our project?
  - We need to get our environments set up.
