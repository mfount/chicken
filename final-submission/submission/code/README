#  Building chicken  #
######################

After much wrestling with the code, we managed to get it down to one
makefile.

Within the code directory, just run make.

The compiler will create a bunch of files used by coq, along with some OCaml translations
of the sorting algorithm.

#  Stepping through the code  #
###############################

Opening some of the .v files in proof general will allow you to step through
our definitions and theorems. You may need to add to your .emacs file
the following line (where /path/to... is replaced by the absolute path to
the chicken folder):
(custom-set-variables
  '(coq-prog-args '("-I" "/path/to/chicken/folder"))
  '(coq-prog-args '("-R" "." "Chicken"))
)
so that it knows where to find everything.
